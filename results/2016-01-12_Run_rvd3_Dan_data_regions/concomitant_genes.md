2014-07-31 Concomitant Genes - Bio Background
===
Purpose
---
To figure out the biological explanation and/or relationships between the two genes in a pair of identified concomitant genes.

Conclusion
---
**In a pair of concomitant genes, one of them is a regulator of a signaling pathway and the other one translates to be a protein that regulates gene expression.**

Background 
---


Materials and Equipment
---
The identified mutations from Dan's longitudinal data set by Fan.

The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) gives out the description of what the genes do in vivo.

Experimental Protocol
---
Compare and contrast the functions of the genes.

Results
---

####E1. MTH1 & ADE16

**MTH1: chr04:1014740**

Negative **regulator of the glucose-sensing *signal transduction pathway***; 

required for repression of transcription by Rgt1p; 

interacts with Rgt1p and the Snf3p and Rgt2p glucose sensors; 

phosphorylated by Yck1p, triggering Mth1p degradation; 

MTH1 has a paralog, STD1, that arose from the whole genome duplication

**ADE16: chr12:200286** 

**Enzyme** of 'de novo' purine biosynthesis; 

contains both 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase and inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase activities; 

ADE16 has a paralog, ADE17, that arose from the whole genome duplication; 

ade16 ade17 mutants require adenine and histidine

####E2: MTH1 & CDC55

**MTH1: chr04:1014850** see above 

**CDC55: chr07:146779**

Non-essential **regulatory subunit B of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)**; 

localization to cytoplasm requires Zds1p and Zds2p and promotes mitotic entry; 

localization to nucleus prevents mitotic exit; 

required for correct nuclear division and chromosome segregation in meiosis; 

maintains nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14p during early meiosis; 

limits formation of PP2A-Rts1p holocomplexes to ensure timely dissolution of sister chromosome cohesion; 

homolog of mammalian B55

####E3: DAL81 & MUK1

**DAL81: chr09:401526**

Positive **regulator of genes in multiple *nitrogen degradation pathways***; 

contains DNA binding domain but does not appear to bind the dodecanucleotide sequence present in the promoter region of many genes involved in allantoin catabolism

**MUK1: chr16:422269**

**Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)**[a kind of protein]; 

involved in vesicle-mediated vacuolar transport, including Golgi-endosome trafficking and sorting through the multivesicular body (MVB); 

specifically stimulates the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab family members (Vps21p/Ypt52p/Ypt53p); 

partially redundant with GEF VPS9; required for localization of the CORVET complex to endosomes; 

contains a VPS9 domain

Discussion
---
We want to know if the there is any known relationship between the signaling pathway and the protein synthesis.

Section 23.3 The First Step in Amino Acid Degradation Is the Removal of Nitrogen

Furthermore, amino acid degradation products(uric acid) can be used to synthesize new amino acids after removal of one or more amino groups, or they can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle. It can be a theory of how the nitrogen degradation signaling pathway gene and the protein synthesis gene would mutate together.

--- glucose sensing in yeast and other cells

[link](http://www.ccbb.pitt.edu/bbsi/2007/jc_paper/genzor.pdf)

Glucose sensing inducts the gene expressions in yeast. Since glucose sensing helps the yeast receive necessary nutrients, this could be another reason for this pair of genes to mutate together.
