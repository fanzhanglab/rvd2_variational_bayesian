2015-11-05 Plot ELBO rvd3
==============================

Purpose
------------
Plot the converging ELBO of rvd3.

Conclusions
-----------------
The ELBO (the evidence of lower bound of log-likelihood of the data) keeps increasing in the variational EM process.


Background
-----------------


Materials and Equipment
------------------------------


Experimental Protocol
---------------------------


Results
----------- 
Converging ELBO for estimating variational posterior in the event of VAF=$100.0\%$ at median read depth of 30590x.

It takes 60 variational EM iterations to stop converging when the increased ELBO rate is less than $0.1\%$.
